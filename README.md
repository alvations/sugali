This is a legacy repository of the *language identification project for many (many) languages* project for the software project course, [NLP projects for low-resource languages](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/cl4lrl-swp/page.php?id=projects).


Description
=====

Given a string of text in an arbitrary language, can we train a system to recognize what language the text is written in? The project uses three sources of data: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Wikipedia, ODIN, and some portions of the data available from Omniglot. The resulting sytem cover well over 1000 languages with their system.


As a spin-off, we've also produce the **SeedLing** corpus with data from over a 1000 languages. The corpus is freely available on the [SeedLing](https://github.com/alvations/SeedLing) github repository.
