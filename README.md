Final technical report on http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/cl4lrl-swp/data/SugaliPoster.pdf


Description
=====

Given a string of text in an arbitrary language, can we train a system to recognize what language the text is written in? The project uses three sources of data: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Wikipedia, ODIN, and some portions of the data available from Omniglot. The resulting sytem cover well over 1000 languages with their system.

As a spin-off, we've also produce the **SeedLing** corpus with data from over a 1000 languages. The corpus is freely available on the [SeedLing](https://github.com/alvations/SeedLing) github repository. The reference paper for the corpus is on https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-2211/
