\section{Conclusion and Outlook} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have described the creation of SeedLing, a foundation text for a universal corpus, following the guidelines of Abney and Bird (2010; 2011). To do this, we cleaned and standardised data from several multilingual data sources: ODIN, Omniglot, the UDHR, Wikipedia. The resulting corpus is more easily machine-readable than any of the underlying data sources, and has been stored according to the best practices suggested by \newcite{bird2003port}. At present, SeedLing has data from 19\% of the world's living languages, covering 72\% of language families. We believe that a corpus with such diversity of languages, uniformity of format, cleanliness of data, and ease of access provides an excellent seed for a universal corpus. It is our hope that taking steps toward creating this resource will spur both further data contributions and interesting computational research with cross-linguistic or typological perspectives; we have here demonstrated SeedLing's utility for such research by using the data to perform language clustering, with promising results.

SeedLing (data, API and documentation) is currently available via a GitHub repository.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/alvations/SeedLing}} We have yet to fully address questions of long-term access, and we welcome ideas or collaborations along these lines.
