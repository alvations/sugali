Susanne
====
- check the numbers of langs (incl. number with 2+ sources)
- readthrough of paper

Guy
====
- Run/reruns the clustering algorithms
- More explanation of results (incl. qualitative discussion), also clean up & clarify existing discussion

Liling
====
- fix up the repos and API
- move discussion of API and general availability of our corpus/scripts/resources, out of conclusion and into a section of its own. (This should include a summary of what our API can do, mentioning that a detailed manual/readme will be available in the repo)


odds and ends
====
- tidy references (including those in Alexis's recent emails)
- tidy formatting
- clarify point that clean-up of data also reduces (but of course doesn't eliminate) influence of source/domain on data 
- check whether languages are being double-counted between national and international endangerment status.

lower priority than paper writing

- make seedling accessible in universal corpus format (parallel data).
- use morpheme alignment on ODIN
