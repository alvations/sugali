\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have described the creation of a foundation text for a universal corpus, following the guidelines of Abney and Bird (2010; 2011). To do this, we cleaned and standardised data from several multilingual data sources: ODIN, Omniglot, the UDHR, Wikipedia, and the LCC. The resulting corpus is more easily machine-readable than any of the underlying data sources, and has been stored according to the best practices suggested by \newcite{bird2003port}. [Give a summary statistic of size.] To demonstrate the utility of this resource, we used the data to perform language clustering, which gave promising results. We believe that this is the first corpus of its kind, which we hope will act as a seed corpus for the Human Language Project.
